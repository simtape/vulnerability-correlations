# Vulnerability correlations
Scripts used to process data and stream on Gephi. The studies have as main goal the facilization of the creation of a network analysis based on the vulnerabilities in packages. The data used has been retrieved from the opensource database https://public.vulnerablecode.io/ 
The network created have as nodes the packages and the edges the vulnerabilities that two packages share.
# API-calls-vulnerablecode
This file has some functions that help to retrieve data from vulnerablecode, using the endpoints provided by the database, searching by package or by vulnerability.
# data-processing
## grouping_by_packages()
Takes as input the filepath of the API calls response by package and create a JSON file where the keys are the packages and each package has an array with its vulnerabilities.
## stream_packages_as_nodes(filepath: str)
Takes as input the filepath of the JSON package/vulnerabilities produced by the function grouping_by_packages() and streams, on Gephi, the packages as nodes and the vulnerabilities as edges.
# Requirements
